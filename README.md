## Summary
# Hole People Product Case Study – Retention & Monetization Optimization

## Introduction
This project is a data-driven analysis aimed at optimizing retention and monetization strategies for Rollic's mobile game, *Hole People*. The goal is to understand user behavior across different segments and identify actionable insights to improve in-game revenue and player engagement.

## Key Insights
- **High Viewer Segment:** High Day 1 and Day 7 retention, but low IAP (in-app purchase) conversion.  
- **Low Viewer Segment:** Low retention overall.  

The analysis suggests that while High Viewers are highly engaged, they have untapped spending potential. Low Viewers disengage quickly, likely due to difficulty spikes or ad fatigue.

## Action Plan
**Proposed A/B Test:** Offer a **“Remove Ads” discount** to High Viewer users.

1. **Hypothesis:** High Viewers are more likely to make a purchase if given an ad-free experience.  
2. **Implementation:** Target High Viewer users with an in-game popup offering the discounted ad removal.  
3. **Measurement:** Compare IAP conversion rates and average revenue between the test group and a control group.

## Conclusion
This case study provides actionable insights for rapid testing and iteration, enabling Rollic to optimize both retention and monetization strategies. The analysis directly informs potential A/B tests and in-game improvements to maximize player engagement and revenue.
